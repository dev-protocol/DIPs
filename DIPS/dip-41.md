## Sentence Summary

This proposal calls for New Markets (example: Research) to have their own native APY based on DEV staked and assets onboarded.

## Paragraph Summary

## Component Summary

## Motivation

This proposal also prevents the devaluation of work from different Markets, increases Market health, and creates Market APY arbitrage opportunity.

## Specification / Proposal Details

Currently, if a New Market is added to Dev Protocol the assets are lumped together. For a Market's creators this is detrimental because the work of one sector is not equivalent to the work of another. For example, a Youtube content creator vs. an OSS developer. Each Market should have its own Native APY to provide so that the APY places a value on the Market's creator's work. This proposal also prevents the devaluation of work from different Markets, increases Market health, and creates Market APY arbitrage opportunity.

### Overview

The feature will be implemented by creating a fork of the Dev Protocol for each New Market.
